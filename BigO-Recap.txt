    Recap      
        . To analyze the performance of an algorithm we use Big O Notation
        . Big O can give us a high level understanding of the time or space complexity of an algorithm
        . Big O doesn't care about precision, only about general trends (linear? quadratic? constant?)
        . The time or space complexity (as measured by Big O) depends on the algorithm, not the hardware used to run the algorithm
        . Big O notation is everywhere so let's get lots of practice!
