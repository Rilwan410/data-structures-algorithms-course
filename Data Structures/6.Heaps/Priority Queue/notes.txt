Priority Queue

    What is a Priority Queue?
        - A Priority Queue is a data structure where each element has a priority. Elements with higher priorities are served before elements with lower priorities

    There are different ways of creating a priority Queue
        Arrays
            - You can use and array to create a priority queue. You would have to iterate over the entire array and find the highest item with the highest priority

        Heap
            - It makes more sense to use a heap for a priority queue since a heap is structured so that the highest number or value will be at the top. Heaps have better time complexity than array as well.

            - Heaps and priority queues frequently get conflated with each other because they are so commonly used in tandem, but a priority queue is just a an abstract concept, and can be implemented in different ways.
