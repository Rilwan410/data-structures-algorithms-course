Hash Tables

    What Is A Hash Table?
        - Hash Tables are used to store key-value pairs
        - They are like arrays , but the keys are not ordered
        - Unlike arrays, Hash Tables are fast for all of the following operations:
            - Finding values
            - Adding new values
            - Removing values

    Why Should You Care?
        - Nearly every programming language has some sort of hash table data structure
        - Because of their speed, hash tables are very commonly used 


    Hash Tables used in programming languages
        Python: Dictionaries
        JavaScript: Objects, Maps 
        Java, Go, Scala: Maps
        Ruby: Hashes

        ** JavaScript objects  has some restrictions, but are basically hash tables
