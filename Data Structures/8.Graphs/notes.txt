Graphs


    What Are Graphs?
        - A graph data structure consists of a finite (and possibly mutable) set of vertices or nodes or points, together with a set of unordered pairs of these vertices for an undirected graph or a set of ordered pairs for a directed graph. AKA a graph is a collection of nodes and connections between those nodes.

    Uses For Graphs 
        - Social Networking
        - Location / Mapping
        - Routing Algorithms
        - Visual Hierarchy
        - File System Optimizations
        - Recommendations
            . "People also watched"
            . "You might also like..."
            . "People you might know"
            . "Frequently bought with"
        - And more 




    Essential Graph Terminology
        - Vertex: A Node
        - Edge: Connection between nodes
        - Weight / Unweighted: values assigned to distances between vertices
            . Weighted Graph- Vertices have no value associated to them
            . Unweighted Graph- Vertices have values associated to them
        - Directed / Undirected: directions assigned to distanced between vertices
            . Undirected Graph - No direction associated with an edge
            . Directed Graph - Direction assigned to an edge



    Types Of Graphs

        Adjacency List 
            - With an adjacency list, we would store all the  edge connections for a given node or vertex. So if you wanted to know what edges or connections were between a vertex and another vertex, you would go to that index and theres a list that would contain all of the connections
