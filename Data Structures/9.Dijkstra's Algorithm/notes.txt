Dijkstra's Algorithm

    What is it?
        - Dijkstra's Algorithm (short for Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm) is one of the most famous and widely used algorithms around.

        - Dijkstra's Algorithm finds the shortest path between two vertices on a graph

    Why Is It Useful?
        . GPS - Finding fastest route
        . Network Routing - Find open shortest path for data
        . Biology - Used to model the spread of viruses among humans'
        . Airline Tickets - Finding cheapest route to your destination
        . etc.
