What is a linked list?
    - A data structure that contains a head, tail, and length property
    - Linked list consists of nodes, and each node has a value and a pointer to another node or null
    - The terminology "singly linked list" comes from the fact that each node is only connected one-directionally to the next node. A Doubly Linked list has another connection pointing back to the previous node.

Head                 Length = 4                   Tail
|---------------------------------------------------|
|                                                   |
|                                                   |
|                                                   |
4 ===>  next   6 ===>  next  8 ===>  next  2 ===> null




Linked Lists VS. Arrays:

    Lists
        - Do not have indexes!
        - Connected via nodes with a next pointer
        - Random access is not allowed

    Arrays
        - Indexed in order!
        - Insertion and deletion can be expensive
        - Can quickly be accessed at a specific index


Popping: Removing a node from the end of the Linked List!
