Objectives

    - Define what an algorithm is
    - Devise a plan to solve algorithms
    - Compare and contrast problem solving patters including frequency counters, two, pointer, problems and divide and conquer



What is an algorithm?   

    - An algorithm is, in its core definition, a process of a set of steps to accomplish a certain task
    - Almost everything that you do in programming involves some kind of algorithm
    - Algorithms are the foundation for being a successful problem solver and developer..


How do you improve at writing algorithms?

    - Devise a plan for solving problems
    - Master common problem solving patterns


Problem Solving Patterns
    . Understand the Problem
    . Explore Concrete Examples
    . Break It Down
    . Solve/Simplify the Problem
    . Look Back and Refactor
