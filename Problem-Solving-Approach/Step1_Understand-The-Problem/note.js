// 1. Can I restate the problem in my own words?

/* " implementing addition" 

// 2. What the inputs that go into the problem?
/* */

// 3. What are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem?

// Should it be an integer? a float, can you return a string? 

// 4. Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? In other words, do I have enough information to solve the problem


// 5. How should I label the important pieces of data that are a part of the problem?
