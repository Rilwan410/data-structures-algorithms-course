Pure Recursion Tips 
    - Pure recursion is when you use a purely recursive function to handle an algorithm instead of nesting a helper recursive function inside of a non-recursive function (helper method recursion)

    - For arrays, use methods like slice, the spread operator, and concat that make copies of arrays so you do not mutate them

    - Remember that strings are immutable so you will need to use methods like slice, substr, or substring to make copies of strings

    - To make copies of objects use Object.assign, or the spread operator
