The Call stack

    - In almost all program languages, there is a built-in data structure that manages what happens when functions are invoked. It's named the Call Stack
        . The Call Stack is a stack data structure
        . Any time a function is invoked it is placed (pushed) on the top of the call stack
        . When JavaScript see the return keyword or when the function ends, the compiler will remove (pop) the top item from the stack 

Why is this useful?

    - You're used to functions being pushed on the the call stack and popped off when they are done 

    - When we write recursive functions, we keep pushing new functions onto the call stack!
