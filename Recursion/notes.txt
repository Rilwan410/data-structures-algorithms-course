Recursion

    .Objectives

        - Define what recursion is and how it can be used

        - Understand the two essential components of a recursive function

        - Visualize the call stack to better debug and understand recursive functions

        - Use helper method recursion and pure recursion to solve more difficult problems



    .What is Recursion?

        - A process (or a function in our case) that calls itself


    .Recursion is Everywhere

        - JSON.parse / JSON.stringify
        - document.getElementById and DOM traversal algorithms
        - Object traversal
        - We will see it with more complex data structures
        - It's sometimes a cleaner alternative to iteration


    . How recursive functions work
        - Invoke the same function with a different input until you reach your base case
        
    .Base Case
        - The condition when the recursion ends
        - This is the most important concept to understand


    .Two essential parts of a recursive function:
        - Base Case
        - Different Input


    .Where things go wrong
        - Not having a base case
        - Forgetting to return or returning the wrong things
        - Stack overflow (call stack exceeded)
