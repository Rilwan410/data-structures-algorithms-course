When determining the time complexity of an algorithm, there are some helpful rules of thumb for big o expression

    - Constants don't matter
        . if you have an operation that comes out to O(2n) you can simplify it to O(n)
        . if you have an operations that comes out to O(500) you can simplify it to O(1)
        . if you have an operations that comes out to O(13n^2) you can simplify it to O(n^2)

        O(n + 10) == O(n)
        O(100n + 50) == O(n)
        O(n^2 + 5n + 8)
