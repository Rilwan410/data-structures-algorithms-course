Intermediate Sorting Algorithms
    
    Objectives
        - Understand the limitations of the sorting algorithms we've learned so far

        - implement merge sort

        - implement quick sort

        - implement radix sort


    Why learned this?
        - The sorting algorithms we've learned so far don't scale well
        
        - Try out bubble sort on an array of 10000 elements, it will take quite some time!

        . Faster Sorts
            - There is a family of sorting algorithms that can improve time complexity from O(n^2) to O(n log n)

            - There is a trade off between efficiency and simplicity

            - The more efficient algorithms are much less simple and generally take longer to understand
