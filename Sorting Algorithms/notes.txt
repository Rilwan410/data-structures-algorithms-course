What is Sorting?
    - Sorting is the process of rearranging the items in a collection (e.g. an array) so that the items are in some kind of order   
        Examples:
            . Sorting numbers from smallest to largest
            . Sorting names alphabetically
            . Sorting movies based on release year
            . Sorting movies based on revenue

Why do we need to learn this?
    - Sorting is an incredibly common task, so it's good to know how it works

    - There are many ways of sorting things, and different techniques have their own advantages and disadvantages

    - Classic interview topic to know. Good critical thinking challenge

Objective
    - implement bubble sorting
    - implement selection sorting
    - implement insertion sorting
    - Understanding why it is important to learn these simpler sorting algorithms

JavaScript has a sort method
    - Telling JavaScript how to sort 
    
        . The built-in sort method accepts an optional comparator function

        . You can use this comparator function to tell JavaScript how you want it to sort

        . The comparator looks at pairs of elements (a and b), determines their sort order based on the return value:
            . If it returns a negative number, a should come after b, 
            . If it returns a positive number, a should come after b
            . If it returns 0, a and b are the same as far as the sort is concerned
