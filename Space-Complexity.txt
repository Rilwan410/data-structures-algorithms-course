- So far we have been focusing on time complexity: how we can analyze the runtime of an algorithm as the size of the inputs increases. Now let's talk about the space.

- We can also use Big O Notation  to analyze the space complexity: how much additional memory do we need to alocate in order to run the code in our algorithm 

- SPACE COMPLEXITY RULES OF THUMB 
    . Most primitives( booleans, numbers, undefined, null) are constant space
    . Strings require O(n) space (where n is the string length)
    . Reference types are generally O(n), Where n is the length (for arrays) or the number of keys (for objects)
